To use this code, you need:

1- Go to Google APIs Console and create a new project to get your credentials, and download a JSON file
rename it to "client_secret.json" and put it on same directory.
2-File "settings.py" with your SENDER_EMAIL and SENDER_PASS information (to use it with SMTP)
3-Code file "email-remainder-gdrive.py" that runs all the code.

I use "Jupyter notebooks" or "Visual Studio Code" to run Python.
